In which condition ArrayList should be used.
- Helpful in programs where a lot of manipulation is needed
- The size does not need to specified since it is a dynamic array -- adjusts as items are added and removed

In which scenario Map should be used.
- used for key-value association mapping -- lookups, retrievals, updates of elements by key
- e.g., map of classes (key) and students (value)

For which scenario Set should be used.
- when order does not matter and values must be unique
- e.g., for a collection of usernames that are used a key, therefore cannot contain duplicates
